          <h3>Brochure Design for College Fest</h3>
          <p>
            The project is about the creation of a visually appealing and
            informative brochure for the cultural fest of IIIT Ranchi, designed
            by a team of students. The brochure showcases various events,
            performances, and activities that will take place during the fest.
            The goal is to promote the cultural fest and encourage student
            participation while contributing to the campus community.With our
            collective skills in UI/UX design, we worked to create a design that
            is both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.

          <h3>Travel and Tourism website</h3>
          <p>
            This is a personal project on UI/UX design for travel and tourism. I
            aim to create a user-friendly platform for travelers to plan and
            book trips, prioritizing safety and comfort. With the pandemic
            affecting travel, I want to offer a fresh approach. I hope to
            showcase my design skills and create a tool to help people explore
            the world and create memories.

          <h3>Resturant Landing Page</h3>
          <p>
            Here is a personal UI/UX design project for restaurants and food.
            The goal is to create visually appealing and user-friendly
            interfaces for browsing menus, ordering food, and making
            reservations. The design emphasizes the uniqueness of each
            restaurant, while also creating a seamless and enjoyable experience
            for users. The project aims to help restaurants connect with
            customers and users to discover new restaurants and cuisines, making
            the dining experience engaging and memorable.

          <h3>Budget Tracking App</h3>
          <p>
            As a young adult and designer, I understand the challenges of
            managing finances and staying within a budget.So I designed a budget
            tracking app designed for youth.It aims to create a user-friendly
            and visually appealing interface that will help young people track
            their expenses and make better financial decisions. Through this
            project, I hope to showcase my skills in UI/UX design while creating
            a tool that can help young people become more financially
            responsible and independent.

          <h3>Posters</h3>
          <p>
            Posters have a unique ability to catch people's eye and convey a
            message in a way that other mediums may not be able to. As a
            designer, I love the challenge of creating posters that are not only
            visually appealing but also effectively communicate the intended
            message to the viewer, whether it's through typography, imagery, or
            color.

          <h3>Daily UI Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            As a designer, I enjoy participating in the Daily UI Challenge,
            which is a design challenge that requires me to create a user
            interface (UI) design every day for 100 days. The challenge is an
            excellent way to develop my skills and boost my creativity by
            providing me with a different prompt or task each day, ranging from
            designing a dashboard to creating a checkout form..Participating in
            the Daily UI Challenge has been a fantastic experience for me as a
            designer, helping me to experiment with different design techniques
            and UI elements. The challenge has pushed me to think outside the
            box and come up with unique design solutions, improving my skills in
            UI/UX design.
